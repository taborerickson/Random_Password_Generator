# Random Password Generator
Simple program to generate a random password

This project uses the random and string libraries to generate a random password with the length of the password being specified by the user. 

The available characters are generated to include capital letters, lowercase letters, and digits. 
The user specifies the desired length of the password, then the program randomly selects from the list of available characters to generate a password with the user-specified length. 

Documentation for the libraries used can be found here:
